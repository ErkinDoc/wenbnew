        "question": "What results can I expect?",

        "answer": "6D diagnostic navigates six clinical vectors of your health: Diagnosis, Dysfunction, Disconnection, Direction, Development, and Depth. It creates a functional map of your system, identifies the key 'bottleneck', and builds a personalized recovery pathway based on evidence-based medicine (ICD, ICF, EBM)."
