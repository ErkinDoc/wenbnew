Dr. Erkin found the systemic cause in 90 minutes: chest breathing (18 cycles/min instead of 12), vitamin D deficiency (22 instead of 50+), weak gluteal muscles. In 6 weeks, pain dropped from 7/10 to 2/10. Most importantly - I understood WHY."

Non-surgical approach: movement retraining + pain neuroscience education. 6 months later: pain 7/10 to 2/10. Avoided second surgery."
